# mifare_classic_wrapper
Arduino project - simple wrapper for the mifare classic 1K RFID cards - based on the popular MFRC522 library.

Adds an abstraction layer on top of the library, making it quick and easy to get RFID projects up and running without having to delve too deep into the MFRC522 code. Ideal for this commonly found SPI module - https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-rfid-read-and-write-module/p/XC4506
